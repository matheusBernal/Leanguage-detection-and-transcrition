# Azure Speech Studio - Language Detection and Transcrition
This project utilizes the Azure Speech Studio services to detect the spoken language in an audio/video file and transcribe it into text with automatic translation. The demonstration uses an English clip from a Batman animation to showcase the transcription and translation capabilities.

Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to explore how Azure Speech Studio can process multimedia files, detect spoken language, and generate text transcripts. The project includes:

Input video/audio file.
Generated .txt output with the transcription and translation.
Repository Structure
inputs/: Contains the original video file used for testing.
outputs/: Includes the .txt file generated by Azure Speech Studio with the transcription and translation.
README.md: Project documentation detailing the process and results.
Process
Upload Video File: The input file (inputs/batman_clip.mp4) was uploaded to Azure Speech Studio.

Language Detection and Translation:

Tool Used: Azure Speech Studio.
Steps:
The service automatically detected the language as English.
A transcription was created for the dialogue in the video.
The service translated the transcription into the specified language.
Save Results: The transcription and translation were exported as a .txt file and stored in the outputs/ folder.

Results
Below is an example snippet from the transcription:

Original English Audio:
"We have to get you out of the sun."

"Just go leave me alone." 
"I can't." 

"You definitely can."

"What? She's a monster?"

Translated Text (e.g., Portuguese):
"We have to get you out of the sun."

"Just go leave me alone." 
"I can't." 

"You definitely can."

"What? She's a monster?"
